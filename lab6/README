Directions:

Windows:
   -Install MPIDE for arduino from https://github.com/chipKIT32/chipKIT32-MAX/downloads.
   -Adjust the environment variable 'MPIDE_PATH' to point at the root folder of your MPIDE installation.
   -If Windows does not automatically install them, download and install the FTDI drivers from http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm
   -Drag and drop .s file onto arduino_compile.bat.
   -Drag and drop .hex file produced during compilation onto arduino_program.bat

Mac:
   -Install MPIDE for arduino from https://github.com/chipKIT32/chipKIT32-MAX/downloads.
   -Adjust the environment variable 'MPIDE_PATH' to point at mpide.app correctly..
   -Download and install the FTDI drivers from http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm
   -Open terminal.app in /Applications/Utilities
   -Run compile script using /path/to/script/arduino_compile.sh /path/to/lab/lab.s
   -Run program script using /path/to/script/arduino_program.sh /path/to/lab/lab.hex

Both scripts can be used from the command line as expected.  Main should be located in main.cpp. Do not remove this file or core.a.  Keep these files in the same directory as your lab.s file.
